## IBM Quantum Challenge Overview

As part of QCHack 2022, IBM Quantum is providing the following challenge for hackathon participants. The full challenge will be released on the morning of Saturday, April 9th. All projects can be maintained as issues on this GitHub page, but need to be submitted directly to the QCHack organizers on Sunday morning. If you do not submit your project to the organizers before the deadline, it is disqualified.

## Before starting

<dl>
    <dt name="get-prepared">Get Prepared</dt>
    <dd>
Check the [preparation & installation document](preparation%26installation.md) note for things to do before the hackathon.

</dd>

        
IBM Quantum offers a variets of learning materials around Qiskit. First - check out the replay of Abby Mitchell's [QCHack Qiskit tutorial here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1448227260). Next, explore the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook-beta/) which has chapters on nearly every side of quantum computing. Finally, watch some videos on the [Qiskit YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/c/qiskit). 

All the proposed projects should make use of some part of Qiskit (including the backends). They can also extend Qiskit or analyze it in some way. See the full challenge document for details.

## Team formation

<dl>
    <dt name="participate">I'm already on a team</dt>
    <dd>

 Great! We think teams of 3 to 5 people would be best suited for the IBM Challenge.
        
</dd>
    <dt name="reassign">I don't have a team yet</dt>
    <dd>

That's ok! Make sure you post in the Discord channel letting others know which challenge you're interested in working on, and a little bit about yourself. Everyone signed up for QCHack shares the same drive as you do to build something awesome, so it'll be hard to go wrong. Some things that you may want to consider are time zones and interests of each team member. Aligning on those factors may leads to a more seamless experience.

</dd>
   <dt name="nothing">I'd prefer to work on this alone</dt>
<dd>

That's ok, but the IBM Challenge is definitely aimed at teams in terms of the amount of work expected within just 24 hours. It's very possible for someone to complete the challenge alone, but all final projects will be judged against each other regardless of team size.

## The hacking part of the hackathon

<dl>
  <dt name="ready">My team is ready. Let's hack!</dt>  
  <dd>
      
IBM Quantum will have a few team members around on Saturday morning and early afternoon to help answer questions or provide guidance, but then the rest is up to you. Some general tips for success:
      
      - Set small goals and continue to iterate
      - If something isn't working, don't waste too much time trying to fix it
      - Communicate constantly with your teammates 
      - Have fun
      - Seriously, have fun! 

</dd>

## It's submission time!

Remember, all projects must be submitted through QCHack. For IBM Quantum's challenge, we also expect you to submit a presentation along with your project. Your project presentation can either be a YouTube video (no longer than 5 minutes) or a powerpoint slideshow (no more than 12 slides). Our judges will be reviewing your projects on Monday and Tuesday, so make sure your presentation clearly outlines the project your built, your team members, and everything you're proud of. 

[This article](https://medium.com/qiskit/6-tips-for-an-amazing-qiskit-hackathon-presentation-e6cea20ce3b3) has good advice that coaches and judges have been collecting during past Qiskit Hackathons. 



NOTE - mention how they'll be graded against each other, mention presentation only needed for tier 2, mention how the issue should be set up on this github to link to other, refer people to Slack as well
